*** Dependencies ***

To run, paf requires the Boost library.  Most of GNU/Linux
distributions have it in their repositories.  Simply use your package
manager to install it.  Notice however that Debian and its derivatives
(including the *buntu) split that library into several packages.  If
you run one of them, you must install libboost-dev,
libboost-program-options and libboost-program-options-dev.

To manually install the Boost library (for example if you are running
a proprietary operating system), this Web page may help you:
http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/index.html


*** Compilation ***

paf was meant to be built with either GCC version 4.9 or later or
Clang.  One can modify the variable CXX in Makefile to use another
compiler.  With clang++-9, the produced executable is ~24% faster to
grow patterns than with g++-9.  It is ~2% slower to amalgamate them.

To install paf and its man page on a *NIX-like operating system,
execute (with administrator privileges):
# make install

If you do not have access to administrator privileges or if you do not
run a *NIX-like operating system, execute:
$ make
The executable, called paf, is created in the working directory.  You
can then move it to a personal directory listed in your PATH variable.


*** Compilation Options ***

Several options can be easily enabled (respectively disabled) in
Parameters.h by uncommenting (respectively commenting) them:

NCLUSTERBOX_UPDATES_SUMS makes nclusterbox update (rather than compute
from scratch) the sums of the membership degrees on all elements after
each addition/remotion step.

NCLUSTERBOX_REMEMBERS makes nclusterbox store every pattern that it
reaches to avoid redundant computation if it is reached again.

VERBOSE_PARSER turns on the output (on the standard output) of
information when the input data are parsed.

DEBUG_NCLUSTERBOX turns on the output (on the standard output) of
information during the execution of nclusterbox.  This option may be
enabled by who wishes to understand how nclusterbox modifies a small
number of patterns.

DEBUG_GROW turns on the output (on the standard output) of information
during the growing of the patterns.  This option may be enabled by who
wishes to understand how a small number of patterns grow.

DEBUG_AMALGAMATE turns on the output (on the standard output) of
information during the amalgamation of the patterns.  This option may
be enabled by who wishes to understand how a small number of patterns
are amalgamated.

DEBUG_SELECT turns on the output (on the standard output) of
information during the selection of the patterns.  This option may be
enabled by who wishes to understand how a small number of patterns are
selected.

NUMERIC_PRECISION turns ou the output (on the standard output) of the
maximal possible round-off error made when internally storing a
membership degree for growing and amalgamating and, then, for
selecting.

NB_OF_PATTERNS turns on the output (on the standard output) of the
numbers (in this order) of:
- density-maximized patterns
- grown patterns
- patterns candidates for selection
- selected patterns

AICC turns on the output (on the standard output) of the AICc of the
selected model.

TIME turns on the output (on the standard output) of the run time of
paf.

DETAILED_TIME turns on the output (on the standard output) of a more
detailed analysis of how the time is spent.  It lists (in this order):
- the tensor parsing time
- the tensor shifting time
- the inital density maximization time
- the inital sub-pattern discarding time
- the further growing time
- the amalgamation initialization time
- the amalgamation time
- the tensor reduction time
- the selection time

GNUPLOT modifies the outputs of NUMERIC_PRECISION, NB_OF_PATTERNS,
AICC, DETAILED_TIME and TIME.  They become tab separated values.  The
output order is:
- tensor parsing time (#ifdef DETAILED_TIME)
- numeric precision for growing and amalgamating (#ifdef
  NUMERIC_PRECISION)
- tensor shifting time (#ifdef DETAILED_TIME)
- inital density maximization time (#ifdef DETAILED_TIME)
- inital sub-pattern discarding time (#ifdef DETAILED_TIME)
- number of density-maximized patterns (#ifdef NB_OF_PATTERNS)
- further growing time (#ifdef DETAILED_TIME)
- number of grown patterns (#ifdef NB_OF_PATTERNS)
- amalgamation initialization time (#ifdef DETAILED_TIME)
- amalgamation time (#ifdef DETAILED_TIME)
- number of patterns candidates for selection (#ifdef NB_OF_PATTERNS)
- numeric precision for selecting (#ifdef NUMERIC_PRECISION)
- tensor reduction time (#ifdef DETAILED_TIME)
- number of selected patterns (#ifdef NB_OF_PATTERNS)
- AICc (#ifdef AICC)
- selection time (#ifdef DETAILED_TIME)
- total time (#ifdef TIME)

If any of those compilation options is used, an output file different
from the standard output should always be defined through the runtime
option --out (-o).
