-----------------------------------ALGORITHM-------------------------------
Cancer is an algorithm for subtropical (max-times) matrix factorization.
Input:   (A, k), where A is a nonnegative real matrix and k>0 is an integer
Output:  [B, C] - factor matrices of rank-k subtropical decomposition of A
                  A ~ BC (product is with respect to max-times algebra)



-----------------------------------BACKGROUND------------------------------
Max-times (subtropical) algebra is defined over the set of nonnegative real 
numbers and has its addition defined to be the operation of taking the 
maximum. Unlike the related max-plus (tropical) algebra it has standard 
multiplication. A logarithmic function provides an isomorphic mapping from
subtropical to tropical algebras. 



-----------------------------------USAGE-----------------------------------
SETUP:   
run "setpath" prior to executing the algorithm

ALGORITHM: 
Basic usage:  [B, C] = Cancer(A, k)
A  - input matrix (nonnegative, real)
k  - rank (positive integer)
B  - first factor
C  - second factor
for more options see the code in Cancer.m



-----------------------------------EXPERIMENTS-----------------------------
Synthetic:  In your terminal run "./runTests.sh" from the root directory
Real-world: 

run "realWorld"
worldclim: rename the dataset as 'data/worldclim.mat' and run worldclim()
NPAS: rename the dataset as '/data/NPASdata.mat' and run NPAS()
eigenfaces: rename the dataset as '/data/YaleB_32x32.mat' and run eigenfaces()
4News: rename the dataset as '/data/news.mat' and run news()
HPI: rename the dataset as '/data/HPITables4.mat' and run HPI()

Alternatively, after downloading and renaming datasets, just run real_world().
The information on how to find the real-world datasets can be found in the paper.
