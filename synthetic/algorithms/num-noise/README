*** DESCRIPTION ***

num-noise turns a "perfect" Boolean tensor fuzzy.


*** USAGE ***

Usage: num-noise dataset-sizes nb-of-correct-observations-per-tuple nb-of-incorrect-observations-per-tuple

dataset-sizes is a string of n integers giving the sizes of the
tensor, e.g., "4 8 16" (here n = 3, i.e., the tensor has three
dimensions).

nb-of-correct-observations-per-tuple and
nb-of-incorrect-observations-per-tuple are two double float
values. They respectively fix the number of correct observations per
tuples and the number of incorrect observations per tuples. The more
correct observations and the less incorrect ones, the less noise
introduced in the tensor. The probability distribution of the altered
'0' (resp. '1') values is the inverse of the beta distribution with
the parameters nb-of-correct-observations-per-tuple + 1 and
nb-of-incorrect-observations-per-tuple + 1 (resp. the same parameters
but swiched).


*** RETURN VALUES ***

num-noise returns values which can be used when called from a
script. They are conformed to sysexit.h.
* 0 is returned when num-noise terminates successfully.
* 64 is returned when num-noise was called incorrectly.
* 65 is returned when an input data line is not properly formatted.


*** INPUT DATA ***

The input data is read on the standard input. It is a list of n-sets
(where the number of dimensions, n, must be the same as that of the
dataset). The elements of these n-sets must be integers between 1 and
the size of the dimension. They are separated by commas and the
dimensions are separated by spaces.

Notice that this input can be every n-tuple at '1'. It can also be the
output of the gennsets command. The data-size option of gennset
command would typically be the same as that of the num-noise
command. Nevertheless, when calling num-noise, setting higher values
may be interesting: it forces the fuzzy tensor to contain elements
(those with the highest values) that are not involved in any pattern.


*** OUTPUT DATA ***

num-noise writes, on the standard output, every n-tuple in the tensor
and its membership degree (between 0 and 1). Like in the input format,
their n elements are space-separated integers between 1 and the size
of the dimension. Notice that this is the input format of DCE and a
particular case of that of multidupehack.


*** EXAMPLE ***

A typical use of num-noise taking as input gennsets' output:
$ gennsets "8 8 8" sizes.data hidden-patterns | num-noise "8 8 8" 1 0 > fuzzy-tensor

sizes.data must list, on every line, the sizes of some 3-sets.
