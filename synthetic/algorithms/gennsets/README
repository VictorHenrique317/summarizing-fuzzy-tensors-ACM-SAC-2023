*** DESCRIPTION ***

gennset generates randomly positioned n-sets of any sizes in a null
tensor of any sizes.


*** USAGE ***

Usage: gennsets dataset-sizes n-set-size-file [output-file]

dataset-sizes is a string of n integers giving the sizes of the
tensor, e.g., "4 8 16" (here n = 3, i.e., the generated tensor has
three dimensions).

n-set-size-file is a file listing, on every line, the sizes of an
n-set. The number of dimensions, n, of these patterns must be the same
as that of the dataset. E.g., to generate three 3-sets of sizes
"2 2 2", "1 3 1" and "3 1 3", it must be:
2 2 2
1 3 1
3 1 3

output-file is a file where the n-sets are written. The patterns are
always printed on the standard output too. This option is useful to
not lose the patterns if gennsets' output is piped in another command
(like num-noise).

*** RETURN VALUES ***

gennsets returns values which can be used when called from a
script. They are conformed to sysexit.h.
* 0 is returned when gennsets terminates successfully.
* 64 is returned when gennsets was called incorrectly.
* 74 is returned when data could not be read or written on the disk.


*** OUTPUT DATA ***

The elements in the patterns are integers between 1 and the size of
the dimension. They are separated by commas and the dimensions are
separated by spaces. Notice that this is the input format of the
num-noise command.


*** EXAMPLE ***

A file sizes.data contains the sizes of three 3-sets. Experiment!
